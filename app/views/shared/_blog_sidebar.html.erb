        <p class="mb-0">I make mistakes and I surely learn from other people's success and failures. The journey to <em>becoming a fullstack developer</em> has been really tough and I have enjoyed every bit of it. <br> I have spent over 40 hours a week writing code for the past 4 years, and what I have realized is that I'm always a beginner. I value all the help I got from my mentors, friends and blog post I read, meetups were the best.</p>
